This is my first project as a Data Scientist proposed by Data Science Academy from Data Scientist Formation program.

TalkingData AdTracking Fraud Detection Challenge

Challenge information, dataset and detailed issue information can be found at:

https://www.kaggle.com/c/talkingdata-adtracking-fraud-detection/

As my first analysis, I tried to apply my knowledge acquired so far, and I realized that I had acquired a certain maturity.

The first version was submitted for evaluation and corrections were made according to the Feedback.

As a first challenge, I realize that I am really on the right path in pursuit of my training as a data scientist

I used the R Language as proposed in the challenge, as a way to improve my knowledge in this language.

I realized that it is necessary to test several packages to work better with a large volume of data and I chose the ones that brought a performance within the expectations.

I tried to optimize the codes in order to run even on computers with few resources.

All the code is commented with the most relevant analysis as well as alerts about possible needs for greater processing power.

I am available for any questions or clarifications!

Thank you !
